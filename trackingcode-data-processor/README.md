### Problem

You will need to write a tracking code processor, which will given a large set of tracking codes (`trackingCodes.csv`) and a destination zip code, will return a sorted set of possible service levels (usps_priority, fedex_ground, etc)


### To get started:

1. Install Node 8 (https://nodejs.org/en/). 
2. (optional, recommend) Install VSCode
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Run tests: `npm test`
